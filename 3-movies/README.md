# Movie propositions engine
### Problem:
```
Currently, based on the collection of videos and user ratings, we are not able to assess which video a given user should watch.
```

### Resolution:
```
This simple movie suggestion engine processes the collected data and then informs the user what movies he should watch and what movies he should not watch (based on ratings)
```

### How to run
Please install:
- Python
- pip
- execute `python3 main.py --user USER`, where `USER` is your username,
