# Stratego
##### (PL - https://zabawnik.org/wystarczy-kartka-i-dlugopis)

### Rules:
```
This is a strategy game formerly known as "The Funeral".
It is said that it was played by impetuous regulars of port pubs.

It is really exciting. In the original the playing field is a 7 × 7 or 8 × 8 square,
but for simplicity this game has a 4 x 4 square game field.

Players should use pens of two different colors.
The one who begins to paint over any one box, the other does the same.
If the painted squares fill a row, column or diagonal line (from edge to edge),
you get as many points as the squares counted by the section you color (minimum 2 squares).

It may happen that coloring one square "closes" even a few point-bearing sections,
then each section is counted separately, and all points are added up and included.

Have fun!
