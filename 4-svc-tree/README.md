# SVC & Decision tree
### Problem & resolution:
```
Excercise represents SVC and Decision tree algorithms.  
SVC is a supervised learning model with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.  
Decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.
```

### How to run
Please install:
- Python
- pip with packages: numpy, mlxtend, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- for SVC execute `python3 svc/main.py`, 
- for Decision tree execute `python3 tree/main.py`,
