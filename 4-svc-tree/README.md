# SVM & Decision tree
### Problem & resolution:
```
Exercise represents SVM and Decision tree algorithms.  
SVC is a supervised learning model with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.  
Decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.

### Wheat seeds dataset:
```
The Wheat Seeds Dataset involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat.

It is a multiclass (3-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 210 observations with 7 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Area.
Perimeter.
Compactness
Length of kernel.
Width of kernel.
Asymmetry coefficient.
Length of kernel groove.
Class (1, 2, 3).
```

### Hayes-Roth dataset:
```
Concept learning and the recognition and classification of exemplars.

1. name: distinct for each instance and represented numerically
2. hobby: nominal values ranging between 1 and 3
3. age: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4
4. educational level: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4
5. marital status: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4
6. class: nominal value between 1 and 3

Human subjects classification and recognition performance:
1. decreases with distance from the prototype,
2. is better on unseen prototypes than old instances
3. improves with presentation frequency during learning.
```


### How to run
Please install:
- Python
- pip3 install -r requirments.txt
- for SVC execute `python3 svm.py`, 
- for Decision tree execute `python3 tree.py`,
