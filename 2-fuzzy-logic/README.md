# Performance grade system
### Problem:
```
We would like to help with calculating students final grade based on three inputs (values are percentages achieved in particular category by student):
- homeworks (how many percentages from homeworks student achived)
- final test (how many percentages from final test was achieved)
- attendance (how often student was present on lessons in percentages)
We used fuzzy logic to calculate such result. Final grade is presented in form of diagram which shows to tutor what grade should be given.
```

### How to run
Please install:
- Python
- pip
- packages (pip3 install -r requirments.txt)
- run this file in the console. (python3 main.py x y z), where x is attendance y is homework z is test (values are percentages achieved in particular category by student)
